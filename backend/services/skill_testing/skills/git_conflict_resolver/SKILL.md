## Instructions

1. Read the conflicted file content using `read_file`.
2. Parse conflict blocks starting with `<<<<<<<` and ending with `>>>>>>>`.
3. Decide on conflict resolution strategy (keep HEAD, incoming, or combine).
4. Rewrite the file using `edit_file` removing conflict markers.
5. Stage the file using `terminal_shell` (`git add <file_path>`).
