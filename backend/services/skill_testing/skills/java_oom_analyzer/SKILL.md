## Instructions

1. Read the GC or error log using `read_file` on `log_file_path`.
2. Identify memory leak symptoms (e.g. progressive memory consumption or specific class instance counts).
3. Use `search_code` to search for resource leaks, unclosed streams, static collections, or infinite loops in the codebase.
4. Outline recommendations or edit classes to close resources properly.
