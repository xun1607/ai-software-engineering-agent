## Instructions

1. Read the thread dump at `thread_dump_path` using `read_file`.
2. Locate the section labeled 'Found one Java-level deadlock'.
3. Extract the locked monitors and the stack traces of the competing threads.
4. Search the files using `search_code` to identify the synchronized blocks or `ReentrantLock` instances.
5. Recommend reordering the lock acquisition to avoid cyclic dependency.
