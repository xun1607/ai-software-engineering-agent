## Instructions

1. Use `search_code` in `source_dir` looking for `.getConnection(` or `.prepareStatement(`.
2. For each hit, check if the resource is closed in a `finally` block or instantiated in a `try-with-resources` statement.
3. If a leak is found, refactor the code to try-with-resources using `edit_file`.
4. Compile and test the project.
