## Instructions

1. Read `file_path` content using `read_file`.
2. Locate the loop where the list/map is being traversed and modified simultaneously.
3. Replace standard collections with `CopyOnWriteArrayList` or `ConcurrentHashMap`, or modify the traversal to use iterator's explicit `remove()` method.
4. Write back modifications using `edit_file` and compile with `compile_project`.
