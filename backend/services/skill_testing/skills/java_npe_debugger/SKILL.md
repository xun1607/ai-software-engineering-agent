## Instructions

1. Read the code context using `read_file` around `line_number` in `file_path`.
2. Locate the reference that is causing the NullPointerException.
3. Wrap the statement with a null-safety check or initialize the reference appropriately.
4. Write the fix back to the file using `edit_file` or `write_file`.
5. Run `compile_project` to ensure the compilation succeeds.
